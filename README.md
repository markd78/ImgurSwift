# ImgurSwift
Uses the Imgur API to search, display albums and images (with pinch to zoom)

It uses MVVM architecture pattern.  
Each class has a single responsibility for better re-usability and testability

Next steps would be:
   add image caching library such as Kingfisher or Alamofire 
   add unit tests and UI tests
   Would be nice to have auto-complete for the search
   Add spinner for each image while waiting to load
   Add paging to the API calls
